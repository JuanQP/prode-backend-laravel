# Prode Laravel Backend

It's the same backend for [this project](https://github.com/JuanQP/prode) but made with Laravel.

## How to run it

```sh
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

Then, in another terminal run:

```sh
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
```

Now you can visit the API in http://localhost/api/hello-world
